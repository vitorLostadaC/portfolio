            üòç, I started my journey like most developers, I wanted to create
            games, but as you&apos;re looking at this portfolio, maybe some
            things have changed, haha. I still love games, and probably will
            create games one day, but just on the veeery distant future.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a routine to do all the things without it, I&apos;m lost so I
            always take a time do anything that I want like work, time to study,
            reading, going to the gym, resting, play a game, recording videos...
            and this is a pretty good summary of my last years.
          </p>
          <p>
            when I&apos;m not learning about development, I try improve my soft
            skill, mainly studing about psychology. These knowledge really help
            me to have a different perspective from the world, understand more
            about people and how they work. Also helping me to be more dicipline
            and mental control, focus on the things that I want.
          </p>

            I always teaching what I learn, these is one of the reasons to me
