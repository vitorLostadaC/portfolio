              I&apos;m Vitor, a software engineer from Brazil. I&apos;m really
              passionate with ui and build beautiful things with great
              animations üòç, I start my journey as the most developers, I wanted
              to create games, but as you&apos;re looking at this portfolio,
              maybe some things have changed, haha. I still love games, and
              probably will create games one day, but just on the veeery distant
              future.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a routine to do all the things without it, I&apos;m lost so
              I always take a time do anything that I want like work, time to
              study, reading, going to the gym, resting, play a game, recording
              videos... and this is a pretty good summary of my last years.
            </p>
            <p>
              when I&apos;m not learning about development, I try improve my
              soft skill, mainly studing about psychology. These knowledge
              really help me to have a different perspective from the world,
              understand more about people and how they work. Also helping me to
              be more dicipline and mental control, focus on the things that I
              want.
            </p>
            <p>
              and when I&apos;m not doing something for my professional I like
              to spend a time with my girlfriend or playing a game, I really
              like play games, I play a lot of games, and I always try teaches
              everthing that I learn, I think with this I learn more because
              when I teach I try explain the best way I can
            </p>
            <p>
              I always teaching what I learn, these is one of the reasons to me
              created a youtube channel, I really like to teach and share my
              knowledge with others and as a bonus I can learn more when I teach
