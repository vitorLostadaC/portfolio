    . We found an opportunity with AI and decided to create this SaaS to try
    selling it to other businesses. We needed to{' '}
    <Highlight>ship fast</Highlight> to get our space in the market. I built the
    whole application (backend and frontend), and he worked on the AI API. We
    had many challenges and had to stop thinking{' '}
    <Highlight>like developers</Highlight> and start thinking like{' '}
    <Highlight>CEOs</Highlight>.

    <Highlight>
      We built the project like it was for a big company with a mature product
    </Highlight>
    . At the start, I used best practices and design patterns, but the project
    took too long to build and ship. Because of that, we couldn&apos;t test if
    the product was useful. The first thing I changed was moving to a{' '}
    <Highlight>simple MVC</Highlight> approach, which made everything faster to
    build.
  </>,
  <>
    Since we were working in our free time, we hired an intern. I planned their
    tasks so they could work on things like improving the UI and making it
    responsive. Meanwhile, I focused on the{' '}
    <Highlight>core logic and main features</Highlight> of the product.
  </>,
  <>
    Another challenge was{' '}
    <Highlight>figuring out how to sell the product</Highlight>. We started by
    initiating affiliate partnerships to have others sell the product for us,
    which helped us connect with key market players.

    I learned a lot about <Highlight>business</Highlight> because the final user

    <Highlight>more critical than perfection</Highlight> in coding.

    When you <Highlight>mentor people</Highlight>, their performance{' '}
