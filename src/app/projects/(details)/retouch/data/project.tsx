    where you can generate images using{' '}

      AI

      design and UX

    . So please don&apos;t worry if you see something that looks a bit ugly,

      coolest and hardest

    to build. I had to learn a lot about graphics, images, canvas, WebGL, and

      simple retouch tool

    , similar to what OpenAI offers when you generate an image. But over time,
    we wanted to improve the user experience. The CEO had the idea to turn our
    application into an{' '}

      infinite canvas
    </RN>{' '}
    with integrated generations and retouch tools. To make it more useful for
    our target users, we had to add features like Photoshop layers, masks,

      best AI experience

    and a great environment that wouldn&apos;t limit their creativity.

      I implemented

    I ran into{' '}

      all
    </RN>{' '}
    the issues you can imagine, haha. So I&apos;ll just briefly go over some of
    them.
  </>,

    Starting out, when I got this task, I was{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-2)">
      really lost
    </RN>{' '}
    and had no idea how to build it. I think the incremental implementation
    approach really helped me figure things out. There isn&apos;t much content
    online about this since it&apos;s a niche area. I started by trying to
    understand what a canvas is, the{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-1)">
      concepts under the hood
    </RN>
    , and exploring libraries that could make development easier. I ended up
    starting with Konva.js, taking{' '}
    <RN type="box" multiline color="var(--highlight-2)">
      baby steps
    </RN>{' '}
    and building one feature at a time.
  </>,
  <>
    Structure wise, one of the things I had in mind when planning this project
    was how to create a{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-2)">
      maintainable structure
    </RN>
    . To figure this out, I looked at{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-1)">
      open-source projects
    </RN>{' '}
    like Excalidraw to see how they organize their structure, and I built
    something similar.
  </>,

    Performance became a challenge as the project grew bigger and more complex
    with{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-2)">
      lots of states
    </RN>
    . We started having performance issues, so I decided to use{' '}
    <RN type="box" multiline color="var(--highlight-1)">
      Zustand
    </RN>{' '}
    for state management and ensured that only the components needing updates
    were re-rendered. I also used `useMemo` and `useCallback` to optimize
    performance. To be honest, it&apos;s not perfect yet because we had other
    priorities, but now that the core features are done, improving performance
    will be our next focus.

    Honestly, I could write more than four pages about the issues I faced, but I
    think that might be boring. If you have any questions, feel free to{' '}

export const lessonsTitle = 'Lessons Learned'

export const lessonsDescription = [

    This project really taught me a lot of things,{' '}
    <RN type="box" multiline color="var(--highlight-1)">
      not just
    </RN>{' '}
    about{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-2)">
      technical
    </RN>{' '}
    programming, but about{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-1)">
      priority
    </RN>
    . So I&apos;ll split this section into two parts.
  </>,
  <>
    First, this project required me to have good knowledge of graphics, which I
    didn&apos;t have before. So I needed to{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-2)">
      study a lot
    </RN>
    , and I spent most of my day learning the basics I needed. I already had
    this discipline from university, but not as strong. Now I have a{' '}
    <RN type="circle" multiline color="var(--highlight-1)">
      good base
    </RN>{' '}
    about graphics, and I keep learning and trying to use canvas more, even
    casually like with the shaders on my hero or for 3d things.
  </>,
  <>
    Second, to build this project I had to learn a lot, but because Resleeve is
    a startup, I needed to prioritize things. I was working alone and had to{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-2)">
      ship stuff while learning
    </RN>{' '}
    at the same time. What I did was understand what features really needed to
    be built with{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-1)">
      solid engineering
    </RN>{' '}
    and what could just have a{' '}
    <RN type="underline" multiline color="var(--highlight-2)">
      duct tape fix
    </RN>{' '}
    that wouldn&apos;t cause problems later. I had to think about the
    company&apos;s timing, resources, and focus my studies and priorities in the{' '}
    <RN type="box" multiline color="var(--highlight-1)">
      same direction
    </RN>
    .
