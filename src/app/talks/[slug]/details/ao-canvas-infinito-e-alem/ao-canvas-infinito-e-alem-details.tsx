    This was my <Highlight>first talk at a conference</Highlight>. I don&apos;t
    have issues with anxiety, but I was a bit nervous not about speaking in
    public, but about <Highlight>keeping the audience engaged</Highlight> and
    clearly sharing what I wanted to say. After talking with everyone, I was
    really happy with the <Highlight>feedback they gave me.</Highlight> Some
    people pointed out things I could improve for next time, and I truly
    appreciate that. <Highlight>Feedback helps us keep improving.</Highlight>

    I think the <Highlight>most exciting part</Highlight> I noticed is that when
    you&apos;re a speaker, other speakers want to talk with you, and other
    people also want to <Highlight>talk with you.</Highlight> This is the part I
    really loved because I had the opportunity to talk with{' '}
    <Highlight>great developers,</Highlight> who work at big companiesa and it
    was <Highlight>truly amazing.</Highlight>
    This networking is the best thing I gained from this experience and
    motivates me even more to keep putting myself out there on the internet and
    try to speak at more conferences.

    I talked about how an <Highlight>infinite canvas</Highlight> works under the
    hood and how I built it. I explained concepts like relative positioning and
    the canvas view, how movement and scaling work, how to interact with the
    canvas from the client&apos;s perspective, the future of infinite canvas,
    the UX perspective, and more. But my <Highlight>main focus</Highlight> was
    to <Highlight>explain the foundation</Highlight> so everyone could build
    their own infinite canvas without being tied to any specific canvas library.
