    I think the{' '}

      most exciting part

    I noticed is that when you&apos;re a speaker, other speakers want to talk

      talk with you.

    This networking is the best thing I gained from this experience and

    try to speak at more conferences.

      infinite canvas

    works under the hood and how I built it. I explained concepts like relative

    interact with the canvas from the client&apos;s perspective, the future of
    infinite canvas, the UX perspective, and more. But my{' '}
